Questions are implemented in the google colab platform with extension of .ipynb.
There is use of colab's kernel, therefore, it is better to use it in colab platform to run the program.

In Q1,
google drive should be mounted. And, zip file of the dataset should be in
"gdrive/MyDrive/cs464_hw2_dataset/afhq_dog.zip" this directory.
If these 2 conditions provided properly then the code runs without mistake.
Explanations of the functions are clear with their name and they are explained
in the code blocks.


In Q2,
I could not finish this question I showed in the .ipynb file my work clearly.
